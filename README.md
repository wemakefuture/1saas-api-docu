# Getting Started

### Platforms:

0CodeKit is available on Make.com Zapier and n8n. We also offer direct API access.

### Code Kit:

We offer both Python and JavaScript code execution.

### Javascript and Python

{% hint style="info" %}
There are two methods to return your result.

`result = { "data": YOURVARIABLE }`

Or just:

`return { "data": YOURVARIABLE }`

Both methods will return the result in the JSON\
`{ "data": YOURVARIABLE }`
{% endhint %}
