## Can I use 1SaaS for free?

Yes there is a **freemium version, were you can use 25 calls per month.**

By signing up here: [https://my.1saas.co/](https://my.1saas.co) you automatically get 25 executions for free!

## What happens when I run out of executions?

At the beginning of the new billing cycle we will reactivate your subscription and you can use 1SaaS again.

**You can upgrade 1SaaS** in your client portal to a higher plan. The remaining executions will be added to your account as long as your remaining subscription period lasts.
